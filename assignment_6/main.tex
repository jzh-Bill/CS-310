\problem{1} Given the input 3406, 6672, 4669, 1509, 8446, 9991, 3723,
9381, and 3441, in that order, and the hash function $h(x) = 6 - (x
\bmod 7)$, draw the resulting hash table. State and explain any
assumptions you make.

\textit{Answer:}
Since hash the module number is 7, therefore the size of the array will be 7 starting from index 0, also it is a prime number. There is no number hashed into index 1 and 3, so there is empty place.

\problem{2}
Based on the first question, we could find out there are 3 collisions, which is too many on index 2. So the table should be rehashed into another table whose size is a prime number and more than twice the original size. Thus, the size should be 17, which is twice more than 7 and is a prime number. And the hash function is $h(key)$ = 16 - ($key$ mod 17), which resulted the table as follows.
From the result follows, there are only 1 collision happened on index 2 and only 52.9$\%$ of the entries are occupied.

\problem{3}
See the submitted file.
\newpage

\problem{4}\textit{Answer:}
Based on my code, the table size I chose is 102407. Which is the nearest and the prime number greater than 102401-the number of the words in the words file. The result I got is 37607 collisions. And the load factor is $\frac{102401}{102407}$ $\approx$ 0.9999414, which is most approximately equal to 1. The closer load factor approach to 1, the better performance the code could be.
